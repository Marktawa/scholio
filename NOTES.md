I want to design the school website project called "Scholio". The website which is a landing page will include a header section, a hero section, a "Welcome section (Welcome message from the Principal)" a "Our Services" section, an "About Us" section, a "Our Staff" section, a "Reviews" section, a "Contact Us" section, a Footer section.

For now just detail the Informational considerations you would give to this website. What would you include in the Header, Hero and Footer section only. From an Informational (Content) perspective as it relates to schools. Keep it minimal, short, concise and straight to the point.

Next detail the UI design considerations for the Header, Hero and Footer as well. For the header I expect the school name at left corner. 4 quick links in the middle (Home, About, Services, Contact). The far right corner should be a drop down link called "MENU". The following links should appear in the drop down (Home, About, Services, Contact, Principal's message, Reviews).

The Responsive design should have 3 breakpoints. [Desktop, Tablet, Mobile]. The middle 4 quick links in the Header disappear in Tablet dimensions. While the school name on the left remains and the "MENU" dropdown on the right remains.

Keep it minimal, short, concise and straight to the point.

The limitations are as follows. No animations. No hover effects. Use one web safe font (Not Arial). No forms. Use three colors (Black, white and Blue). Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Think along the lines of a minimal design. Source images from an Image Library like Unsplash. Get icons from an icon library like FontAwesome etc.

Put your considerations in a doc called: "Scholio Design Document" markdown.

The new Scholio project should be minimal, simple, and straight to the point. No animations. No hover effects. 3 colours to be used (white, black, and any other colour). No forms. The sections to be considered are a header with school name at left corner. 4 quick links in the middle (Home, About, Services, Contact). The far right corner should be a drop down link called "MENU". The following links should appear in the drop down (Home, About, Services, Contact, Principal's message, Reviews).

The Responsive design should have 3 breakpoints. [Desktop, Tablet, Mobile]. The middle 4 quick links in the Header disappear in Tablet dimensions. While the school name on the left remains and the "MENU" dropdown on the right remains.

Start with the informational(content) requirements then move on to the UI design requirements. Keep it short, minimal, and concise. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One web safe font. Font Awesome icon library for icons. Source images from an image library like Unsplash. 

The other sections to include are the Hero section and Footer section for now. Make sure your decisions align well with a school website design. Keep it short, minimal, and concise. Give me your output as a document.

Following the specifications outlined in the document, create a web page for the Scholio project. The output should be one HTML file.

Now that the first sections are done, create for me a document outlining the content requirements as well as the design requirements for the remaining pages of the website. The pages are [About, Services, Principal's message, Reviews, Contact]
